    <h1>About Fake News Detection System</h1>

    <p class="about-text">
        The Fake News Detection System is a web-based application designed to
        identify whether a given news article is genuine or misleading.
        With the rapid spread of information through digital platforms,
        verifying the authenticity of news has become a critical challenge.
        This project aims to address that challenge using Machine Learning
        and Artificial Intelligence techniques.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Objective</h3>
    <p class="about-text">
        The primary objective of this project is to help users analyse news
        content and determine its credibility. The system provides an
        easy-to-use interface where users can paste a news article and
        receive a classification result along with a confidence score.
    </p>

    <h3>Technology Used</h3>
    <ul class="about-list">
        <li>Python & Flask for backend development</li>
        <li>Machine Learning models:
            Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
            Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree
        </li>
        <li>TF-IDF Vectorization for text feature extraction</li>
        <li>Google Gemini AI for additional verification and explanation</li>
        <li>HTML & CSS for user interface design</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How the System Works</h3>
    <p class="about-text">
        When a user submits a news article, the text is first cleaned and
        processed. The processed text is then analysed by multiple machine
        learning models trained on labelled news datasets. Each model
        provides its own prediction.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
        In addition to machine learning models, the system uses Google
        Gemini AI to further verify the news content. The final decision
        is made using an ensemble voting mechanism, and a confidence score
        is calculated based on the combined results.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul class="about-list">
        <li>Multiple machine learning models for improved accuracy</li>
        <li>AI-based explanation for better transparency</li>
        <li>User-friendly and clean interface</li>
        <li>Reliable and stable performance without external dependencies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="about-text">
        This project demonstrates how machine learning and artificial
        intelligence can be effectively combined to tackle real-world
        problems such as fake news detection. The system is intended for
        educational and academic purposes and highlights the practical
        application of data science concepts.
